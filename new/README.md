# Remote Browser — VPS Setup Guide

A screenshot-based remote browser. Your VPS runs a real Chromium browser,
takes screenshots, and sends them to your phone. Your phone shows the image
and uses its **native keyboard** for input.

## How the keyboard trick works

Most remote desktop tools stream video — your phone sees a video frame,
not a real webpage, so the native keyboard never pops up.

This project detects **input field positions** on the remote page and draws
invisible tap zones over the screenshot. When you tap one:
1. A hidden `<input>` on your phone gets `.focus()` called → **native keyboard appears** ✅
2. You type → each keystroke is sent to the VPS → VPS types in the real browser
3. New screenshot is sent back in ~300ms

## VPS Setup (Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04)

### 1. Install Node.js 20+
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### 2. Install system dependencies for Playwright/Chromium
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libnss3 libnspr4 libdbus-1-3 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
  libcups2 libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 \
  libxfixes3 libxrandr2 libgbm1 libasound2
```

### 3. Upload & install
```bash
# Upload the remote-browser/ folder to your VPS, then:
cd remote-browser
npm install
npm run install-browser    # downloads Chromium (~170MB)
```

### 4. Start the server
```bash
node server.js
# → Remote browser server listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

### 5. Open on your phone
Visit `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:3000` in your mobile browser.

## Run as a persistent service (optional)

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name remote-browser
pm2 startup          # auto-start on reboot
pm2 save
```

---

## Open firewall port (if needed)

```bash
# UFW
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp

# iptables
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
```

## HTTPS (for production / iOS PWA)

For HTTPS, put it behind Nginx + Let's Encrypt:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

## Portability & Persistent Logins

This project is **100% portable**. It does *not* use Chrome's standard, OS-encrypted profile directory (which breaks if you move the project to a different PC).

Instead, it uses Playwright's native `storageState` feature. 
When you log into websites via `setup.js` or the main server, your session (cookies and local storage) is periodically saved as plain-text to a local file named `auth.json` in the root of the project.

Because of this:
- **No re-logins needed:** You can copy this entire project folder to a new computer, a different VPS, or a USB drive, and your browser will remain logged into all your accounts.
- **Easy manual setup:** Run `node setup.js` to open a local window, log in to Facebook/Instagram/etc., and then close it. The sessions are saved in `auth.json` and automatically loaded by the remote headless server (`node server.js`).
